      <h1>Rhosync</h1>
<p>
Rhosync is a Ruby-based framework to access data from various backend
applications and sync them to remote devices. Specifically it is a Ruby on
Rails application that allows managing backend application sources and user
subscriptions to those data sources. It is optimized for delivery of
ongoing incremental updates of those data sources to users accessing that
data via mobile devices.
</p>
<h3>Design Goals</h3>
<p>
RhoSync retrieves data via web services (REST or SOAP) from backend
enterprise applications for distribution to downstream mobile devices. It
keeps a master store of all enterprise application data and keeps track of
the information that users have received. It is written to be far simpler
to be far simpler
</p>
<pre>
 to deploy and configure than similar technologies that have come and gone
</pre>
<p>
over the past decade.
</p>
<p>
It is also more focused on the complete end to end &#8216;web service
backend&#8217; to mobile device (with an enabling master data store on the
server) than earlier equivalents. These products were generally focused on
the device endpoint syncing to a server-based database. With the success of
Software as a Service (SaaS) products such as SugarCRM and SalesForce,
synchronization directly to a server database is much more rarely a viable
option. Instead we focus on the web service access scenario. Rhosync is
also focused on arbitrary enterprise application data as opposed to being a
PIM and email focused product such as Funambol.
</p>
<h1>SYSTEM INSTALLATION AND USAGE</h1>
<h3>PREREQUISITES</h3>
<pre>
    * Ruby on Rails Version 2.1
    * mySQL, SQLite or other database that plays nicely with Rails
</pre>
<h3>ADMINISTRATION</h3>
<pre>
    * install the Rails application files (generally by unzipping)
    * set up the database, generally by running “rake db:migrate”
</pre>
<h3>SET UP A BACKEND DATA SOURCE</h3>
<pre>
    * we ship with an example &quot;Source&quot; out of the box for integrationg with
      SugarCRM
    * This is delivered in the Sources.yml files that should execute when you run the migrations.
       The Ruby code to interact with the backends is populated into those source records
    * Edit the “login”, “password” and “URL” fields if you are using one of the existing sources
    * Otherwise create a new Source from the application main menu and edit those same fields.
    * If you are using another backend you may need to create “prolog”, “call”,
     &quot;createcall&quot;, &quot;updatecall&quot;, &quot;deletecall&quot;,  “epilog” and “sync” fields with the appropriate code. See “Creating a Rhosync Datasource”
</pre>
<h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>
<p>
Rhosync normalizes all backend application data into a common server-based
database schema, in preparation for delivering the further downstream,
generally to mobile devices.
</p>
<p>
Specifically the “master server data table” is a “property bag”
model, which keeps track of data sources, individual objects and the
name/value pairs
</p>
<pre>
 for those objects. This allows handling of diverse backend application data
</pre>
<p>
structures within a single master store. It also provides for efficient
delivery
</p>
<pre>
 of single “fields” of data in either direction (e.g. just the status changing
</pre>
<p>
of a trouble ticket).
</p>
<p>
The connection code for logging into a backend application (via REST or
SOAP APIs), calling the data retrieval and update functions, logging off,
and populating the master data table are each written in Ruby but stored in
the application sources table. The schema for this table and other tables
involved in supporting this functionality are as described below.
</p>
<h1>DATABASE SCHEMA</h1>
<p>
There are two important tables that describe fully the universe of data
sources and their contents for downstream syncing. These are the SOURCES
table and the OBJECT_VALUES table (and the corresponding <a
href="../../classes/Source.html">Source</a> and ObjectValues models. Other
tables include tables to keep of the mobile device users and their
subscriptions to the various data sources available.
</p>
<h3>OBJECT_VALUES</h3>
<p>
A “property bag” schema that facilitatest importing any kind of data
into a common table for later distribution to downstream clients.
</p>
<pre>
    * object – the unique identifier of the object (generally an integer “record ID” from the backend system)
    * attribute – the name of the attribute (e.g. “Account Name”, “Industry”)
    * value – the value of the attribute (e.g. “Acme Corp”, “software”)
    * source_id – reference back to the source (see below) used for syncing
</pre>
<h3>SOURCES</h3>
<p>
This table contains all of the information necessary to connect to a given
backend system. These includes the URL to connect to and authentication
information.
</p>
<pre>
    * URL – the URL to connect to (for REST adapters) or the URL to the WSDL (for SOAP services)
    * SERVER – OPTIONAL a logical name for the data source server (AcmeCorpSugar)
    * LOGIN – the username or logon ID for the backend
    * PASSWORD – password (stored in the clear right now) for the backend system
</pre>
<p>
Backend Code Columns
</p>
<pre>
    * PROLOG – a set of Ruby code generally for logging into the backend system. Generally this is a SOAP or REST call which populates a session_id variable (that variable must be used in the call code below).
    * CALL – the actual code for getting data back (generally uses the session_id acquired in the prolog)
    * CREATECALL - code to create records in the backend from the object values table
    * UPDATECALL - update code for the backend
    * DELETECALL - record deletion code for the backend
    * LOGOUT – OPTIONAL, code to logoff the backend system
    * SYNC – this is the code used to take apart the returned data and stuff it into the OBJECT_VALUES property bag table. Theoretically this could be done in the CALL column.
