Description:
    This plugin is replicates the base Rails scaffolding but
    produces views in Markaby instead of ERB. It creates a
    MarkabyHelper class as a starting point for writing your
    own Markaby helpers.
    
    It also monkey patches Rails 2.0.2 to fix
    http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/markaby/ticket/58.

    Requires that Markaby plugin is installed.

Examples:
    `./script/generate markaby_scaffold Post` # no attributes, view will be anemic
    `./script/generate markaby_scaffold Post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    `./script/generate markaby_scaffold Purchase order_id:integer amount:decimal`
